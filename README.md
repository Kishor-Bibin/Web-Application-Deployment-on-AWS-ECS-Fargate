## Introduction

The **Roast Coffee Web Application** is a containerized application hosted on AWS with ECS Fargate. The project leverages various AWS services, including **Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** for image storage, **RDS** for data storage, and **Secrets Manager** for secure credential management. This setup ensures scalability, high availability, and security, making it ideal for production environments.

### Why Secrets Manager?

Instead of embedding sensitive database credentials within the application, **AWS Secrets Manager** was integrated to:
- **Enhance Security**: Credentials are stored and rotated securely, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Simplify Credential Management**: Secrets Manager automates credential rotation, ensuring credentials are always up to date.
- **Improve Application Flexibility**: Secrets are dynamically retrieved at runtime, which enables easy updates without code changes.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a secure and scalable web application that connects coffee enthusiasts with Richard Roast. The architecture was designed to support seamless scaling of the application based on user demand and ensure secure data handling with best practices for credential management.

Key functionalities of the application include:
- **User Management**: Store and manage user accounts and preferences.
- **Product Listings**: Display an assortment of coffee products, updated regularly.
- **Order Management**: Securely process and manage orders.

## AWS Services Used

This project uses several AWS services, each serving a distinct purpose:

### 1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
   - Provides network isolation and control over resources.
   - Configured with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones for high availability.

### 2. **Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**
   - Hosts Docker images for easy integration with ECS.
   - Provides a private repository for secure image storage.

### 3. **Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate**
   - Manages containerized applications with a serverless compute engine.
   - Fargate eliminates the need to manage EC2 instances, allowing for easy scaling and management.

### 4. **RDS (Relational Database Service)**
   - A managed MySQL database that handles data storage for user data, orders, and product information.
   - Deployed in a private subnet for enhanced security.

### 5. **Secrets Manager**
   - Manages database credentials securely, with automatic rotation and seamless access from ECS containers.
   - Replaces hardcoded credentials, minimizing security risks.

### 6. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
   - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple container instances.
   - Configured with health checks to ensure reliable service.

### 7. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
   - Manages permissions for ECS tasks and other resources, ensuring least-privilege access.

## Deployment Steps

The following summarizes the deployment process for the Richard Roast application:

1. **VPC Creation**: Set up a VPC with public and private subnets, and configured routing and security groups.
2. **Docker Image Preparation**: Built the application Docker image and pushed it to ECR.
3. **RDS Setup**: Launched a MySQL RDS instance within private subnets and configured the database.
4. **Secrets Management**: Stored database credentials in Secrets Manager with automatic rotation.
5. **Target Group and Load Balancer Configuration**: Created a target group for the ECS service and configured the Application Load Balancer.
6. **ECS Cluster and Task Definition**: Defined ECS tasks using Fargate, set environment variables, and specified networking details.
7. **ECS Service Creation**: Created an ECS service to run the application containers, linked to the load balancer, and enabled auto-scaling.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Managing Database Credentials
**Solution**: Integrated AWS Secrets Manager to securely handle credentials, ensuring they are rotated and stored securely. This approach prevents hardcoding credentials in the codebase, which significantly enhances security.

### Challenge 2: Handling High Availability
**Solution**: Architected the VPC with multiple availability zones and configured ECS Fargate for auto-scaling based on demand. The ALB directs traffic across instances, enhancing reliability and uptime.

### Challenge 3: Network Security and Access Control
**Solution**: Configured security groups to restrict access based on role requirements. Specifically:
- The ALB allows only HTTP traffic from the internet.
- ECS tasks can only access the RDS instance via the Secrets Manager-retrieved credentials.

## Benefits and Features

- **Scalability**: The architecture can automatically scale in response to traffic fluctuations.
- **Security**: Sensitive information like database credentials is securely managed with AWS Secrets Manager.
- **Reliability**: The use of multiple availability zones and load balancing enhances the application's uptime and performance.
- **Serverless Management**: With Fargate, the serverless approach simplifies container management, reducing operational overhead.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Auto-scaling and serverless compute ensure resources are used efficiently, lowering costs and improving performance.

## Future Improvements

- **Multi-Region Deployment**: To further improve availability and disaster recovery, deploy the application in multiple AWS regions.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Integrate Amazon CloudWatch to monitor application performance, with customized alarms and insights.
- **Database Replication**: Enable multi-AZ deployment and read replicas in RDS to improve database redundancy and speed up read-heavy operations.
